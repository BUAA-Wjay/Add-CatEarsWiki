Barron was a happy transgirl who studied painting in Japan. She had a dream to open a comic studio. But unfortunately, due to the family crash and her coming out, she was forced to give up his studies and return to China at the end of May 2023 after tried to commit suicide but survived in Japan.

After returned China, she lost almost all her financial resources. To make matters even worse, she was unable to draw again due to her serious PTSD. She found good friends in Guangzhou who could accompany her, and then live shortly at Beijing. During her live in Beijing, although she was often worried about finance and other issues, he was quite happy with everyone's comfort. She said that she was on a girl's final journey...

However, due to financial reason and her love, she returned to Guangzhou at the end of August. She and her love spent a happy time in Guangzhou, although they had to rely on sex work to survive. Even though she faced challenges in her relationship, she bravely confronted the trials of life. Tragically, she has left us too soon.

The Barron's final journey is end, and I hope she have a happy trip to the heaven.
