Yun didn't leave us much information. Yun was very concerned about the transgender who have passed away, and most of her few tweets are in memory of the transgender who have passed away.

Yun is Suzuki's good friend. He participated in the CatEarsWiki project founded by Suzuki (a transgender science popularization site project similar to mtfwiki), and also founded CatEarsLaboratory (a branch of CatEarsWiki, similar to a blog). In CatEarsLaboratory, she devoted herself to popularizing, but unfortunately she did not leave many articles before her death.

In the New Year of 2023, she said, 「I hope I could take on a train traveling through the Milky Way and give everybody gifts that represent blessings...」 Hope she can become a train heading to heaven bringing our blessings to everyone in heaven.
